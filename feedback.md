| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| **Baseline functionality** | | |
| • Effective and interesting use of the chosen API | API meets criteria | 9/9 |
| • Useful or entertaining presentation of data delivered by the API | Data presentation meets criteria | 8/8 |
| • Formation of API requests based on user input | User input does display new data—but solely from memory, without invoking the API ever again! Note the instructions asked you to provide “at least one use case where the API request is based on user input.” In this case, input is indeed being accepted but it does not result in a new API request. You may as well have just hardcoded the entire beach data as a variable in your app (–4) | 4/8 |
| • Successful deployment to a public site | Deployed with Code Sandbox—and this deployment reveals an issue with how the app’s background image is linked. You weren’t expect to necessarily know why it was broken, but you _did_ notice that it was—I wish you had asked me about it beforehand (–2) | 3/5 |
| **Baseline code quality** | Code generally looks good, but API functions aren't abstracted (your SpotData component shouldn't call `fetch` directly) (–2) | 18/20 |
| **Design & usability** | Looks OK, but no error handling is shown to user on the front end (–4) Also no loading state (–4) | 22/30 |
| **Implementation specifications** | | |
| • Background image or gradient | Meets criteria with background image—but link only works when running locally due to its storage as a source file. Deduction taken elsewhere | ✅ |
| • Non-standard font | Meets criteria with Channel | ✅ |
| • Grid layout | Grid Meets criteria | ✅ |
| • Flex layout | Flex meets criteria | ✅ |
| • Title | Visually, there appears to be a title—“Select a location”—but in terms of its role, it is more of a prompt than a title. However, for all-or-nothing purposes, we will take the intent. Be mindful next time of the actual _content_ shown in an element in addition to how it is displayed | ✅ |
| • Images | Image meets criteria | ✅ |
| • Transition | Transition meets criteria. | ✅ |
| | _All or nothing_ | 15/15 |
| **_about.md_** | | |
| • App and API description | _about.md_ looks good! | 2/2 |
| • Link to API documentation | Link to API meets criteria | 2/2 |
| • Link to app deployment | Link to deployed app meets criteria | 1/1
| Code maintainability | Maintainability sufficient |  |
| Code readability | Code readability sufficient |  |
| Version control | Version control sufficient |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit 10/5 11:36pm. On time. |  |
| | **Total** | **84/100** |
